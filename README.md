# flutter_Beginners
I have created this repository to help beginners create a simple reactive flutter app and embark on the journey of Flutter App Development. 
The repo contains the description of the two apps, their main.dart files, their assests, app icons and screenshots of the finished apps. 
Go ahead, use the resources to make your first flutter app!

Note: The files have been compressed alread, so you can directly download it and start working. All you need to do is create a new flutter project and substitute the resources with the default ones.
